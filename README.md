## Objective

The overall objective with this project is the following: 

	- To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, 
	  methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules 
	  covered during training. 
## Outline

The application being created for this project will be a NFL fantasy football league.  
Users will be able to:
* **Create** an account.
* **Create** their own NFL fantasy league where they can compete with the other players that are invited to that league.
* **Create** a fantasy team by picking available NFL players from a list.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Read** the NFL teams that belong to the other players in that fantasy league.
* **Read** previous and upcoming matchups between the NFL teams in their fantasy league.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Update** their team roster for upcoming matchups (e.g. move up some players from the bench).
* **Update** their profile information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Delete** their account.
* **Delete** their fantasy team.
* **Delete** their fantasy league (if they are the designated league owner who created the fantasy league).

## Scrum-Board

I decided to use Jira for my Scrum Board, as I like the general layout and options it gives to the user.
