## Objective

The overall objective with this project is the following: 

	- To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, 
	  methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules 
	  covered during training. 
---
## Outline

The application being created for this project will be a NFL fantasy football league. The CRUD functionality was updated to discount user logins, as this feature was out of scope for the project. The initial CRUD outline that was planned can be found [here.](./initial-crud.md)

Users will be able to:
* **Create** an NFL fantasy league.
* **Create** an NFL fantasy team by picking available NFL players from a list.
---
* **Read** the NFL teams that belong to a fantasy league.
* **Read** a list of players that belong to each fantasy NFL team.
---
* **Update** team roster (e.g. Add/remove players or move up some players from the bench).
---
* **Delete** a fantasy team.
* **Delete** a fantasy league.

## Scrum-Board

I decided to use Jira for my Scrum Board, as I like the general layout and options it gives to the user.
